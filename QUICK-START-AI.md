## üéØ Where to Find AI Help

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard (Home Page)
**Look for**: AI Insights card with ‚ú® icon

**What you can ask**:

- "How can I save on taxes?"

    2. Increased PF contribution: ‚Çπ700
    
    Your gross pay remained the same at ‚Çπ50,000.
    
    To avoid future unpaid leave deductions, consider planning 
    your leaves within your available paid leave balance (12 days remaining).
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Leave Page
**Look for**: 
- "Ask AI about my leaves" button in Leave Balance card

**What you can ask**:

AI: Your leave request from November 1-5, 2025:

    üìÖ Duration: 5 days (including weekends)
    üíº Type: Paid leave
    üìä Impact on balance:
       - Before: 12 days remaining
       - After: 7 days remaining
