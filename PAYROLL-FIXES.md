# Payroll System Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Employee Salary Structure Creation**
**Problem:** When adding new employees, their salary structure was not created, causing payroll to fail.

**Solution:** 
- Added `basePay` and `allowedLeaves` fields to the Add Employee dialog
- Automatically creates a salary structure record when adding an employee
- Default base pay: ₹50,000/month
- Default allowed leaves: 20 days/year

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/add-employee-dialog.tsx`

---

### 2. **Leave Days Calculation**
**Problem:** Leave requests were not calculating the number of days requested.

**Solution:**
- Added automatic calculation of leave days when submitting a request
- Calculates difference between start and end dates (inclusive)
- Stores `days_requested` in the database for accurate tracking

**Formula:** `Math.ceil((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) + 1`

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/request-leave-dialog.tsx`

---

### 3. **Leave Balance Updates on Approval**
**Problem:** When admin approved leave requests, employee leave balances were not updated.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced leave approval process to update leave balances
- When approved:
  - Fetches current leave balance for the employee
  - Adds `days_requested` to `leaves_taken`
  - Updates the database with new balance
- Denied requests do not affect leave balance

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/leave-action-buttons.tsx`

---

### 4. **Payroll Calculation with Leave Deductions**
**Problem:** Payroll calculations didn't account for unpaid leave days.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced payroll calculation to include unpaid leave deductions
- Fetches approved unpaid leaves for the pay period
- Calculates per-day pay: `basePay / 30`
- Deducts unpaid leave days from net pay
- Properly handles employees without salary structures (skips them)

**Calculation:**
```
perDayPay = basePay / 30
leaveDeduction = perDayPay × unpaidLeaveDays
taxDeduction = grossPay × 0.1
totalDeductions = taxDeduction + leaveDeduction
netPay = grossPay - totalDeductions
```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/run-payroll-dialog.tsx`

---

### 5. **Enhanced UI Display**
**Problem:** Important information like salary and leave balance wasn't visible.

**Solution:**
- **Employees Page:** Now shows salary and available leaves for each employee
- **Leave Management:** Shows leave type (paid/unpaid), number of days, and employee designation
- Better visual indicators with color-coded badges

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/app/app/employees/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/app/leave-management/page.tsx`

## How the System Works Now

### Adding a New Employee (Admin)
1. Admin fills in employee details including:
   - Personal info (name, email)
   - Designation and join date
   - **Base Pay** (monthly salary)
   - **Allowed Leaves** (days per year)
2. System automatically creates:
   - Auth user account
   - Profile record
   - Employee record
   - **Salary structure** with base pay
   - **Leave balance** for active leave periods

### Leave Request Flow (Employee)
1. Employee selects start and end dates
2. System automatically calculates number of days
3. Chooses leave type (paid/unpaid)
4. Provides reason
5. Request goes to admin for approval

### Leave Approval Flow (Admin)
1. Admin sees pending requests with:
   - Employee name and designation
   - Date range and number of days
   - Leave type (paid/unpaid)
   - Reason
2. Admin approves or denies
3. **If approved:** System updates employee's leave balance
4. **If denied:** No changes to leave balance

### Payroll Processing (Admin)
1. Admin selects pay period (start and end dates)
2. System:
   - Fetches all active employees with salary structures
   - Fetches approved unpaid leaves in the period
   - Calculates per-employee:
     - Base pay from salary structure
     - Unpaid leave deduction (days × per-day rate)
     - Tax deduction (10%)
     - Net pay
3. Creates payroll record and individual payslips
4. Status updated to "processed"

## Database Schema Requirements

Ensure your `leave_requests` table has:
- `days_requested` column (integer)
- `leave_type` column (text: 'paid' or 'unpaid')

Ensure your `salary_structures` table has:
- `base_pay` column (numeric)
- `employee_id` column (uuid, foreign key)

Ensure your `employee_leave_balances` table has:
- `total_granted` column (integer)
- `leaves_taken` column (integer)
